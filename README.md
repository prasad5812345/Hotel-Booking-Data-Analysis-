<h1> Hotel Booking Data Analysis </h1>
Here I developed a data analysis project using hotel booking data I sourced from a database I created by uploading Excel data sheets. 
The database was connected to Power BI to answer some business questions and have a visual product at the end.
<br>
also I develop a Data Analytics using python with a Machine learning model to predict the cancellations of the hotel bookings 

<br>
<h3> Stakeholder's questions that need to be answered: </h3>
<li> <h5> " Is our hotel revenue growing over the years? "</h5>
We have two hotel types so it would be good to segment revenue by hotel type. 
<li> <h5> " Should we increase our parking lot size? " </h5> 
We have to understand if there is a trend for guests with personal cars. 
<li> <h5> " What trends can we see in the data? " </h5>
Focus on average daily rate and guests to explore seasonality.

<h3> Project Pipeline </h3>
<li> Build a Database: uploading Excel data sheets -(attached to repo)- to Microsoft SQL Server Studio. 
<li> Develop the SQL Query: queries are attached to the repo. 
<li> Connect Power BI to the Database

<h3>BUSINESS PROBLEM</h3>
In recent years, City Hotels and Resort Hotel have been confronted with high cancellation rates, resulting in a range of issues including reduced revenue and suboptimal utilization of hotel rooms. Both hotels must prioritize the reduction of cancellation rates to enhance their efficiency in generating revenue. In addition, we aim to provide comprehensive business advice to address this challenge. The report will primarily focus on the analysis of hotel booking cancellations, as well as other factors that do not impact the hotels' business and annual revenue generation. By identifying these factors, we will be able to provide valuable insights and recommendations to help the hotels mitigate the issue of high cancellation rates.

It is important to note that the reduction of cancellation rates will not only increase revenue generation efficiency but will also improve the overall reputation of the hotels. Therefore, it is crucial that the hotels take a proactive approach to address this issue and implement the recommended solutions to enhance their financial performance and customer satisfaction.
<h3>ASSUMPTIONS:</h3>
1.No unusual occurrences between 2015 and 2017 will have a substantial impact on the data used.<br>

2.This information is still current and can be efficiently utilized to strategize and plan the hotel's future course of action.<br>

3.Furthermore, there are no unanticipated negative consequences associated with implementing any recommended techniques.<br>

4.However, it is noteworthy that the suggested solutions are yet to be adopted by the hotels.<br>

5.The biggest factor affecting the effectiveness of earning income is booking cancellations.<br>

6.Cancellations result in vacant rooms for the booked length of time.<br>

7.Clients make hotel reservations the same year they make cancellations.<br>
<h4>ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS 1:</h4>
The bar graph accompanying this information depicts the percentage of reservations that have been canceled and those that have not. From the graph, it is clear that there are still many reservations that have not been canceled yet. In particular, it is noticeable that 37% of clients have canceled their bookings, which considerably impacts the hotel's earnings.

<h4>ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS 2:</h4>
In comparison to Resort hotels, City hotels have more bookings. It is possible that resort hotels are more expensive than those in cities.

<h4>ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS 3:</h4>
The line graph shows that on certain days, the average daily rate for a city hotel is less than that of a resort hotel. And on other days, it is even less. Weekends and holidays may see a rise in resort hotel rates.

<h4>ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS 4:</h4>
We have generated a grouped bar graph to analyze the reservation status of different months. From the graph, it is observed that the month of August has the highest number of confirmed reservations as well as canceled reservations. On the other hand, January has the highest number of canceled reservations.

<h4>ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS 5:</h4>
The bar graph demonstrates that high prices correlate with more cancellations, while lower prices lead to fewer cancellations. Therefore, it seems that cost is the primary factor causing cancellations.

<h4>ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS 6:</h4>
Portugal has the highest number of cancellations with around 70% of reservations being canceled, as shown in the pie chart.

<h4>ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS 7:</h4>
Predicting the cancellations in both hotels by using the Logistic Regression Algorithm with their accuracy score.
